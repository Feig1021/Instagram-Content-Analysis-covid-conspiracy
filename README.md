# Reflection-amid-the-Pandemic

<b>This project aims to design a research concept and a code in Python 3 that would support research in the discipline of the humanities by generating evidence from an analysis and exploration of unstructured data.</b>

The COVID-19 health crisis is the first pandemic to occur in the age of social media, where people are ever more interconnected and gain access to an unprecedented amount of information. Information, either true or false, proliferates and flows promiscuously, leading to public uncertainty and anxiety (Fischer, 2020). As early as February 2020, the World Health Organisation warned the world that "we are not just fighting an epidemic, we are fighting an infodemic” (WHO, 2020).  

Unfounded conspiracy thinking has increased substantially on Instagram since the outbreak of the virus, converging on conspiracy theories which is defined here as a model of “interpretation or knowledge production that presents prominent catastrophic events as the result of deliberate plotting in secret by conspirators” (Birchall, Knight, 2020). In particular, discussion about COVID-19 origination has snowballed significantly. Through the conspiracist lens, legitimate questions about it become accusations waged against states, especially China, in terms of COVID-19 as a Chinese bioweapon (Birchall, Knight, 2020). The first QAnon post on coronavirus claimed the same argument (QAnon, 2020, March 24). 

With this in mind, the research question is formulated: <b>how “COVID-19 as Chinese Bioweapon” conspiracy theory narratives by English textual languages on Instagram in 2020 ?</b>
